# Smart Helmet Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for our Smart Helmet project developed using DTH-11, MQ7, NEO 6M, and LoRa modules to transmit data.

## Features
- **DTH-11:** Measures temperature and humidity.
- **MQ7:** Detects carbon monoxide (CO) gas.
- **NEO 6M:** GPS module for location tracking.
- **LoRa:** Long-Range communication for transmitting data wirelessly.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Smart Helmet project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the necessary hardware components (DTH-11, MQ7, NEO 6M, and LoRa modules) according to the provided documentation.
3. Upload the appropriate code to the microcontroller (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Esp, etc.) used in the project.
4. Configure LoRa settings for communication between devices.
5. Power on the Smart Helmet and start monitoring the data.
